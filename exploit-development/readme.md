# theory

## stack buffer overflows

## return-oriented programming

### return-to-libc

TODO write about bypassing the NX bit by jumping to the C standard library

### return-to-PLT

TODO write about bypassing ASLR by jumping to the Procedure Linkage Table

# countermeasures

This section covers exploit mitigation techniques and how to disable them to make writing
the first exploit easier. This should only be done in a VM. This section focuses on Linux and gcc.

## NX bit

NX stands for No eXecute. This technology tries to remedy the issue that the Von Neumann architecture
uses the same memory for instructions and data which can result in arbitrary code execution.

The NX bit allows marking specific segments as executable or not executable.
This prevents arbitrary code execution from the stack (by crashing the process).
It does not prevent return-to-libc attacks as the memory that contains
the C Standard library has to be executable.

---

To enable execution of instructions on the stack, gcc can be passed the `-z execstack` linker flag.

## stack canaries

Also known as stack cookies.

Provide stack smashing protection by pushing an additional value to the stack (on function calls).
On function return that value is checked and if it is incorrect it means the stack has been smashed.
In that case the program terminates with `SIGABRT` and warns about attempted stack smashing:

---

By default this is disabled in gcc, but some distributions patch gcc to enable it.
To disable stack canaries pass the `-fno-stack-protector` flag to gcc.

## ASLR

Address Space Layout Randomization.

---

`echo 0 | sudo tee /proc/sys/kernel/randomize_va_space` (until reboot)

## PIE

Position Independent Executables.

---

`-fno-pie`, `-no-pie`

## CFI

Control-Flow Integrity.

---

`-fcf-protection=none`

# demos

These are small independent demos that demonstrate a single technique each.

## check_pin

This program asks the user for a pin via stdin.<br>
There are three possible outcomes when running it:

1. if the pin is correct it exits with return value `0`
2. if the pin is wrong it exits with return value `1`
3. if the entered value is too long it will crash (due to a programming error)

> check_pin.c

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>

#define INSTRUCTIONS "enter 3 digit pin:\n"

int check_pin() {
	char buffer[4]; // pin + null terminator.
	scanf("%s", buffer); // read pin.
	// compare pin char by char:
	while (strcmp(buffer, "042") != 0)
		return EXIT_FAILURE; // usually 1.
	return EXIT_SUCCESS; // usually 0.
}

int main(int argc, char** argv)
{
	printf("%s", INSTRUCTIONS);
	return check_pin();
}
```

* *note the following:*
  * we reserve 4 Byte for our `buffer` char array
    * 3 for digits + 1 for the C-string `NULL` terminator that `scanf()` returns
  * **we never actually check how long the user input is**

---

Let's compile it!

> compiling check_pin.c with gcc:
```sh
gcc check_pin.c -o check_pin -ggdb \
    -m32 -mpreferred-stack-boundary=2 \
    -z execstack -fno-stack-protector \
    -fno-pie -no-pie \
    -fcf-protection=none
```

* *note the following:*
  * `\`s are used to break up the command into multiple lines
  * `-o` specifies our executable name
  * `-ggdb` tells gdb to add debug symbols in its native format
  * `-m32` create 32-bit machine code
  * `-mpreferred-stack-boundary=2` align stack pointer to 4 Byte (2^n)
  * all the other flags disable various exploit mitigations<br>(see [countermeasures](#countermeasures) section)
