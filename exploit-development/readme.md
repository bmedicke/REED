# theory

## stack buffer overflows

## return-oriented programming

### return-to-libc

# countermeasures

This section covers exploit mitigation techniques and how to disable them to make writing
the first exploit easier. This should only be done in a VM. This section focuses on Linux.

## NX bit

NX stands for No eXecute. This technology tries to remedy the issue that the Von Neumann architecture
uses the same memory for instructions and data which can result in arbitrary code execution.

The NX bit allows marking specific segments as executable or not executable.
This prevents arbitrary code execution from the stack (by crashing the process).
It does not prevent return-to-libc attacks as the memory that contains
the C Standard library has to be executable.

To enable execution of instructions on the stack, gcc can be passed the `-z execstack` linker flag.
