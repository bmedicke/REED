This readme covers the absolute basics while more technical topics (linked throughout) are covered in seperate files.
It's a good idea to read and understand this page entirely before delving into the specifics.

A couple of conventions to make orientation a bit easier:

* links in square brackets refer to one of the sources at the botton, e.g. [[pracbin, p. 27ff]](#sources-and-further-reading)
* links that end with an arrow are in-repo-links, e.g. [exploit-development â†£](exploit-development)

# computer architectures

The following two subsections show the minimal, archetypal representation of both architectures.
Caches (and for that matter cache levels) are ignored.

TODO source this section


## Von Neumann

See [[edvac]](#sources-and-further-reading).

Somewhat controversially named solely after John von Neumann this is still
the base for most common CPU designs.

> architecture-von-neumann.jpg

<img src="media/architecture-von-neumann.jpg" width=500px></img>

* *note the following:*
  * **data and instructions are stored in the same memory**
  * data and instructions are transported over the same bus

## Harvard

> architecture-harvard.jpg

<img src="media/architecture-harvard.jpg" width=500px></img>

* *note the following:*
  * data memory and instruction memory are separated
  * they travel over separate buses

## modern processors

Most modern CPUs use the same memory for data and instructions, like
in the Von Neumann architecture.
To avoid the Von Neumann bottleneck multiple levels of caches are
added between CPU and memory (L1-Ln cache) and a seperate cache
for instructions and data is used in the lowest level (similar to
the Harvard architecture).

The resulting architecture is called Modified Harvard or
to be more specific split-cache/**almost Von Neumann** architecture.

*As such modern CPUs are situated somewhere between a pure Von Neumann and a
pure Harvard architecture.<br>
The important takeaway here is that data and instructions are stored
in the same place!*

### consequences

The - by the Von Neumann architecture - historically caused consolidation of data
(that can be freely written by the process)
and instructions (that are executed by the CPU)
in the same memory has led to countless memory corruption exploits and in
turn a myriad of countermeasures.

# registers

As seen in the drawings of the Von Neumann and Harvard architectures, registers are part of the CPU.
They store a small amount of data and instructions that the CPU can immediately operate on.
As such they are much faster than any other form of storage (HDDs, SSDs, RAM, Cache).

Some registers might be read only or have a specific hardware function.

## the instruction pointer

One important special purpose register is the one that stores the instruction pointer or program counter.
The instruction pointer always points at the instruction that the CPU will execute next. As an internal register
it is not usually directly read or writeable. (Some architectures such as 32-bit ARM do expose it.)

# memory

Memory refers to fast, non persistant storage. Nowadays, (main) memory is usually RAM.

## Bit and Byte order

See [[inteldev, vol. 1, ch. 1, p. 5f]](#sources-and-further-reading).

There are several ways to store multi-Byte data in memory. Today, the two most common are:

* Little Endian (used by x86_32, x86_64)
* Big Endian (AVR32, z/Architecture)

ARM, IA-64 and PowerPC support both for data and instructions.

Endiannes only comes into play when storing multi-Byte data.
Big endian stores the most significant Byte first.
Little endian stores the least significan Byte first.

The big/little refer to the end that is stored first.

> datastructure-byte-order.jpg

<img src="media/byte-order.jpg"></img>

* *note the following:*
  * higher addresses are towards the top
  * higher addresses are towards the left
  * each Byte has its own address
  * the first Byte (Byte 0) is stored first (it gets the lowest address)

---

Bits can be stored in two ways:

* most significant bit first
* least significant bit first

Since the smallest addressable unit is one Byte it usually does not matter.
(Except when working with bitfields or serializing data Bit by Bit via SPI/I2C.)
That said Bit order usually follows the Byte order of the system.

> bit-order.jpg

<img src="media/bit-order.jpg"></img>

* *note the following:*
  * both Byte represent the same number (`13` in base 10)
  * **the drawing shows the order the bits would be stored in (starting left)**
    * the leftmost bit gets the lowest address

## virtual address space

See [[pracbin, p. 27ff]](#sources-and-further-reading).

Modern operating systems create a virtual address space for each process.
Behind the scenes the OS maps the virtual address space to real memory (or disk space).
This is not visible to the process itself.

After setting up the VAS the interpreter is mapped into the newly created userspace.<br>
The interpreter's job is it to perform the required relocations and start our program
(by jumping to its entry point).

## memory layout

See [[compsec, p. 350]](#sources-and-further-reading).

This section assumes an x86_32 Linux with a 1GiB/3GiB Kernel/userspace split.

> process-memory-layout.jpg

<img src="media/process-memory-layout.jpg" width=500px></img>

* *note the following:*
  * high memory addresses are at the top (Intel notational convention, [[inteldev, vol. 1, ch. 1, p. 5f]](#sources-and-further-reading))
  * the stack and heap both grow into free memory
  * the heap grows up
  * **the stack grows down!**
    * the more data is on the stack, the lower the last address
  * **the size of `argc`, `argv`, and the environment influence the offset for addresses on the stack!**
    * potential source of confusion when debugging or developing exploits
    <br>(environment change results in address offset change)
  * `0xFFFFFFFF` to `0xC0000000` is the kernelspace
  * `0xBFFFFFFF` to `0x00000000` is the userspace
  * **CPU instructions (`.text`, shared libs and the interpreter)<br>and data (all the other sections) reside in the same memory**


## the stack

A stacks is a dynamic LIFO (last in, first out) data structure.
It can be primarily interacted with in two ways:

* **push**: add one item to the end
* **pop**: remove the last item from the end (and put it somewhere)

"The" stack often refers to a specific instance of that data structure also known as the hardware stack.<br>
Depending on the language used, its function is to provide a temporary space
for local variables in the current scope, passing parameters between calls,
storing return addresses and more.

**Hardware stacks typically grow down which is counterintuitive to the name.**

You can think of it as a stack of magnets on the ceiling:

> the-stack-push-pop.jpg

<img src="media/the-stack-push-pop.jpg"></img>

* *note the following:*
  * at the start the stack is empty (1.)
  * after we have pushed `variable a` the stack contains a single item (2.)
  * after we have pushed `variable b` the stack contain two items (3.)
    * at this point we have lost direct access to `variable a` (at least to pop it)
    * to pop `variable a` we first have to pop `variable b`
  * the first pop returns `variable b` to us and removes it from the stack (4.)
  * the second pop returns `variable a`, the stack is now empty again (5.)
  * **we don't get to chose which item to pop, it's always the last one added!**

---

Let's take a look at what is specifically stored on the stack.


## the stack at <main+0>

This section assumes an x86_64 Linux.
The following shows a partial dump of the stack at the start of `main()`:

> preparing for the stack dump:
```sh
# we will use the executable from the later 'stages of compilation' section.
# at this point it does not particularly matter though:
gdb a.out

# (gdb)
break *main
run "passed_along_argument"
# at this point we take a look at the stack.
```
> stack-dump-main.jpg

<img src="media/stack-dump-main.jpg"></img>

* *note the following:*
  * as we go further down the stack, memory addresses go down as well (**the stack grows down!**)
  * the lower the data on the screen, the later it was pushed to the stack
  * (a.) shows part of the environment, such as which shell we've used or the default editor
  * (b.) is the argument we started our program with (`argv[1]`)
  * (c.) is the name of the executable (`argv[0]`)
    * **arrays grow up: `argv[0]` is further down the stack than `argv[1]`!**
  * just after (c.) we can see `argc` is 2 (the size of our `argv` array)
  * (d.) contains the latest return addresses
    * **`__libc_start_main + 243` is the operation that will be executed once we return from `main()`**

## stack frames

The stack frame for the current function is the part of the stack
that is used to store local variables for the current function scope.

The current stack frame is delimited by two pointers:
1. The *base pointer*, that points to the start of the stack frame.
2. And the *frame pointer* that points to the end of the current frame.


If a function calls another function a new stack frame is created and the pointers are updated.<br>
As functions return to their calling function, stack frames are removed
and the stack shrinks again.

In this section we will take a look at how this happens one assembly instruction at a time.

> preparing for stepping through the creation of a stack frame:

```sh
# we will use the 'stages of compilation' binary again.
# compared to the previous example we don't pass any arguments. this will
# result in different addresses, even if everything else stays the same.
gdb a.out

# (gdb)
start # shortcut for `break main*` plus `run`
disas main # disassemble main function.
```

> dissassembled main via `(gdb) disas main`:
```sh
=> 0x0000555555555160 <+0>:	endbr64 
   0x0000555555555164 <+4>:	push   rbp
   0x0000555555555165 <+5>:	mov    rbp,rsp
   0x0000555555555168 <+8>:	sub    rsp,0x20
   0x000055555555516c <+12>:	mov    DWORD PTR [rbp-0x4],edi
   0x000055555555516f <+15>:	mov    QWORD PTR [rbp-0x10],rsi
   0x0000555555555173 <+19>:	mov    QWORD PTR [rbp-0x18],rdx
   0x0000555555555177 <+23>:	mov    eax,0x0
   0x000055555555517c <+28>:	call   0x555555555149 <greet>
   0x0000555555555181 <+33>:	mov    eax,0x0
   0x0000555555555186 <+38>:	leave  
   0x0000555555555187 <+39>:	ret    
```

* *note the following:*
  * `=>` marks the instruction, that will be **executed next**
  * `<+n>` shows the offset of an instruction from the start of the function
    * in our case `main+28` would be the call instruction
  * `main+4`, `main+5` and `main+8` are what is called the **function prologue**

---

The following images show the stack before we have executed any instructions (in main):

> stack-frame-main-0.jpg

<img src="media/stack-frame-main-0.jpg"></img>

  *note the following:*
  * the base pointer (`rbp`) points to `0x0`
    * on entry GDB sets all registers (except `rsp` and `rip`) to zero
      * you can observe this behaviour with `(gdb) starti`
    * if we had ran the executable without a debugger it would contain a valid address
  * the stack pointer (`rsp`) points to the end of the previous frame
  * the most recently pushed item is a **return address**
    * it points to an instruction that is part of the C standard library
    * when `main()` exits, the program will continue from here

---

Now we repeatedly call `stepi` and see how the stack
grows during the course of the program.

> stack-frame-main-function-prologue-a.jpg

<img src="media/stack-frame-main-function-prologue-a.jpg"></img>

* *note the following:*
  * (1.) after executing `push rbp` the stack grows by one word
    * a word is traditionally the smallest addressable size of memory
    * 1 word = 8 Byte = 64 bit (we're running on x86_**64** after all)
    * we do this so we can restore the old base pointer
  * (1.) at the same time the stack pointer is updated to point to the new end of our frame
  * (2.) after executing `mov rbp, rsp` both pointers point at the same address (the backup)

---

If we take one more `stepi` we'll be the farthest away from the top we've ever been!

> stack-frame-main-function-prologue-b.jpg

<img src="media/stack-frame-main-function-prologue-b.jpg"></img>

* *note the following:*
  * (3.) after executing `sub rsp,0x20` the stack pointer is updated and the stack grows by 32 Byte
    * we are substracting from the stack pointer because the stack grows down: `0xC0 - 0x20 == 0xA0`
    * the memory is not initialized in any way, whatever was there before still is

---

Instructions `main+12`, `main+15`and `main+19` write data to our new space on the stack frame.
Instruction `main+23` only touches a register.

Let's skip ahead to `main+28`, the function call.

> stack-frame-main-greet.jpg

<img src="media/stack-frame-main-greet.jpg"></img>

* *note the following:*
  * (4.) as part of executing `call 0x555555555149`, the address for `main+33` is pushed to the stack
    * **this is the return address for the instruction that is next in line after we return from `greet()`**
  * a `call` is basically an atomic `push <address_after_call>` plus `jmp <target>`

If we would continue the execution of `greet()` the process would be the same as for `main()`:
  * backup the base pointer to the stack
  * move the base and stack pointers to grow the frame
  * push a return address as we call another function

# stages of compilation

See [[pracbin, p. 12ff]](#sources-and-further-reading).

This section assumes compilation for the x86_64 architecture on Linux.

All intermediary files can be found in the `stages-of-compilation` directory.

---

Let's go through the stages of compilation step by step.
We'll use the following example:

> stages.c

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

#define FORMAT_STRING "%s"
#define MESSAGE "hello, world!\n"

void greet() {
  printf(FORMAT_STRING, MESSAGE);
}

int main(int argc, char** argv, char** envp)
{
  greet();
  return EXIT_SUCCESS;
}
```

* *note the following:*
  * using a `main()` signature with `envp` does not conform to POSIX but is widely supported by Unix-like systems and mentioned as a common alternative in the C standard ([[c11, Annex J.5.1, p. 575]](#sources-and-further-reading))


> run through all stages and save intermediary files:

```sh
uname -a
# Linux ubuntu 5.4.0-48-generic #52-Ubuntu SMP Thu Sep 10 10:58:49 UTC 2020 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux

gcc -masm=intel --save-temps stages.c

# â”œâ”€â”€ stages.c
# â”œâ”€â”€ stages.i
# â”œâ”€â”€ stages.o
# â””â”€â”€ stages.s
```

---

> stages-of-compilation.jpg

<img src="media/stages-of-compilation.jpg"></img>

* *note the following:*
  * produced filenames assume compilation with `--save-temps`
  * on macOS gcc is llvm in disguise and will produce an additional `.bc` bitcode file

## preprocessor

In this first stage the preprocessor does the following:

* all included headers (`#include`) and our source file are (recursively) concatenated in place
* preprocessor macros (`#define`) are expanded

> stages.i (partial)

```c
# 1 "stages.c"
# 1 "<built-in>"
# 1 "<command-line>"
# 31 "<command-line>"
# 1 "/usr/include/stdc-predef.h" 1 3 4

/* ... */

typedef signed char __int8_t;
typedef unsigned char __uint8_t;

/* ... */

extern FILE *stdin;
extern FILE *stdout;
extern FILE *stderr;

/* ... */

# 7 "stages.c"
void greet() {
  printf("%s", "hello, world!\n");
}

int main(int argc, char** argv, char** penv)
{
  greet();
  return 
# 14 "stages.c" 3 4
        0
# 14 "stages.c"
                    ;
}
```

* *note the following:*
  * our 15 line program ballooned to 1837 lines (`wc -l stages.i`)
    * all neccessary (uncompiled) code for the following stages  is now contained within
  * if you grep the file for include or define directives there won't be any (`egrep '#include|#define' stages.i`)
  * the `greet()` function no longer contains the macros for our strings but the strings themselves

## compiler

In the compilation stage our concatenated source is translated into assembly language.
Depending on flags more or less optimization takes place (`-O0` to `-O3`).

> stages.s (Intel syntax)

```asm

```

* *note the following:*
  * if not told otherwise (with `-masm=intel`) gcc creates assembly with AT&T syntax
  * constants and variables have symbolic names and not just addresses (`.LC0` for the hello world string)
  * constants and variables have types
  * functions are easily identified by their labels (`greet:`, `main:`)
  * calls to functions happen via names and not addresses (`call puts@PLT`)
  * our call to `printf` was optimized to `puts`
  * there's not much left of the 1.8k lines from the preprocessor step

## assembler

Now we create a binary file for the first time. But while this object file contains machine code it is not quite executable just yet.

> inspecting the object file:

```sh
file stages.o
# stages.o: ELF 64-bit LSB relocatable, x86-64, version 1 (SYSV), not stripped

xxd stages.o | head -n 1 # hex dump.
# 00000000: 7f45 4c46 0201 0100 0000 0000 0000 0000  .ELF............
```

* *note the following:*
  * the file utility tells us a couple of interesting things:
    * `ELF` stands for Executable and Linkable Format, a file format for executables and object files (among others)
    * `64-bit` since our object file is targeted at x86_64
    * `LSB` stands for Least Significant Byte first (when storing integers)
    * `relocatable` since object files don't have a fixed address in memory
    * `not stripped` means that debug symbols are present
  * **each object files is compiled on its own and thus has no idea of memory addresses of other object files**
  * ELF files start with a bit of *magic*, the bytes: `0x7F` and then the ASCII characters `E`, `L`, `F`

---

> trying to execute an object file

```sh
chmod +x stages.o
./stages.o
# -bash: ./stages.o: cannot execute binary file: Exec format error
```

That did not work, let's see why:

---

C and other high level languages refer to functions and variables with
human readable (symbolic) names. This makes it easier for the programmer.
The CPU on the other hand refers to them directly via memory addresses.

A symbol table is a mapping between the two.

> symbol table via `readelf --syms stages.o`

```sh
Symbol table '.symtab' contains 14 entries:
   Num:    Value          Size Type    Bind   Vis      Ndx Name
     0: 0000000000000000     0 NOTYPE  LOCAL  DEFAULT  UND
     1: 0000000000000000     0 FILE    LOCAL  DEFAULT  ABS stages.c
     2: 0000000000000000     0 SECTION LOCAL  DEFAULT    1
     3: 0000000000000000     0 SECTION LOCAL  DEFAULT    3
     4: 0000000000000000     0 SECTION LOCAL  DEFAULT    4
     5: 0000000000000000     0 SECTION LOCAL  DEFAULT    5
     6: 0000000000000000     0 SECTION LOCAL  DEFAULT    7
     7: 0000000000000000     0 SECTION LOCAL  DEFAULT    8
     8: 0000000000000000     0 SECTION LOCAL  DEFAULT    9

    13: 0000000000000017    40 FUNC    GLOBAL DEFAULT    1 main
```

* *note the following:*
  * for relocatables most symbols point to just zeroes
    * this is because before the linking stage it's unclear where they'll land in memory/the file
    * we will have to resolve them before we can run our binary

## linker

In this stage all object files will be linked together. The result is a single executable. The process is as follows:

1. merge all object files into a single executable
2. resolve (static) symbolic references to now known fixed locations

Static libraries (`.a`) are merged into the executable. Dynamic/shared libraries (`.so`) are left unresolved.
The dynamic linker (interpreter) will resolve these at runtime.

> inspecting the executable:

```sh
file a.out
# a.out: ELF 64-bit LSB pie executable, x86-64, version 1 (SYSV), dynamically linked, interpreter /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2, BuildID[sha1]=41087481fb19eebf518ec7ff727fde7395cdc927, for GNU/Linux 3.2.0, not stripped

# let's finally run it:
./a.out
# hello, world!
```

* *note the following:*
  * `pie` Position Independent Executable, code does not rely on being located in a specific place in memory
    * you can ignore this for now, we'll talk about it later
  * `executable` instead of `relocatable`, which means we can actually run it
  * `dynamically linked` at least some of the used libraries are shared ones
  * `interpreter [...]` which dynamic linker will be used to resolve shared libraries

* *note the following:*
  * **we have two sybol tables now**
    * `.dynsym` is used by the dynamic linker
    * `.symtab` includes the same symbols as `.dynsym` (and more)
    * **`.symtab` is optional at this point** (not necessary for process creation)
  * the functions we've written ourselves (`main`, `greet`) now have locations/offsets
  * the `puts` function from before still has no location (dynamically linked)

---

I've mentioned in the notes above that the `.symtab` symbol table is optional. Let's strip it.

> stripped symbol table via `strip -s a.out && readelf --syms a.out`:

```sh
Symbol table '.dynsym' contains 7 entries:
   Num:    Value          Size Type    Bind   Vis      Ndx Name
     0: 0000000000000000     0 NOTYPE  LOCAL  DEFAULT  UND 
     1: 0000000000000000     0 NOTYPE  WEAK   DEFAULT  UND _ITM_deregisterTMCloneTab
     2: 0000000000000000     0 FUNC    GLOBAL DEFAULT  UND puts@GLIBC_2.2.5 (2)
     3: 0000000000000000     0 FUNC    GLOBAL DEFAULT  UND __libc_start_main@GLIBC_2.2.5 (2)
     4: 0000000000000000     0 NOTYPE  WEAK   DEFAULT  UND __gmon_start__

     6: 0000000000000000     0 FUNC    WEAK   DEFAULT  UND __cxa_finalize@GLIBC_2.2.5 (2)
```

> running a stripped binary works just as well:
```sh
./a.out
# hello, world!
```

* *note the following:*
  * while it still runs the same it is much harder to debug now
  * most binaries you encounter in the wild are stripped

# binary analysis

See [[pracbin, p. 2f]](#sources-and-further-reading).

## static

Static analysis is the process of gaining information about a binary without running it.

*Pros*

* no need for a CPU with a fitting architecture
* no need for additional software to run the binary (Kernel, etc.)

*Cons*

* more difficult to reason about due to missing runtime state

## dynamic

Dynamic analysis on the other hand executes the binary.

*Pros*

* easier, due to additional information (runtime state)

*Cons*

* might miss some code paths
